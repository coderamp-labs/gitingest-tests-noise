# Dr. Elena Kovač, PhD
*Computational Neuroscientist & AI Ethics Researcher*

## Early Life & Education
Born on March 17, 1987, in Zagreb, Croatia, Elena Kovač displayed an early fascination with both the human mind and machines. Her father, a mechanical engineer, and mother, a high school literature teacher, created an environment that balanced technical precision with creative expression. At age 8, she built her first computer from spare parts her father brought home from work.

Elena attended the prestigious XV. Gimnazija in Zagreb, where she excelled in mathematics and physics while maintaining a deep interest in philosophy and psychology. Her senior thesis, "Neural Networks: A Bridge Between Biological and Artificial Intelligence," earned her a full scholarship to study at the University of Zagreb's Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing.
